- 👋 Hi, I’m Mario. The handle is a loose lat-english translation of my last name.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... languages and creative thinking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... software development from scratch @ Codersbay Vienna. Strong focus on Java and JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... learning. A lot.
- 🦡 Fun fact: I borrowed my avatar from a zorilla and it let me.
